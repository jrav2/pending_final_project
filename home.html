        A poached egg is an egg that has been cooked by gently simmering
        it in water without its shell. The cooking method produces a tender egg white that encases a soft,
        runny yolk. Poached eggs are commonly served on toast, salads, or in classic dishes such as Eggs Benedict.
        They are valued for their delicate texture and are often prepared using vinegar or swirling water to help 
        the egg maintain its shape during cooking.

        To achieve the perfect poached egg, cooks often add a splash of vinegar to the water or create a gentle whirlpool
        to help the egg hold its shape. Compared to frying or scrambling, poaching is a healthier cooking method, as it doesn’t
        require added fats or oils. Poached eggs are versatile, nutritious, and visually appealing, making them a staple in many
        cuisines around the world.
